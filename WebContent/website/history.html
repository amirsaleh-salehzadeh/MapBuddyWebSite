				<p>The Math Art competition is an innovative, practical project
					that resulted from the need to promote creativity in problem
					solving by encouraging learners to explore the real-life links
					between mathematics and the arts (which is the aim of the STEAM
					concept in education).</p>
				<p>The Govan Mbeki Mathematics Development Centre (GMMDC)
					launched the Math-Art competition project in the Eastern Cape high
					schools in March 2018. The MATH-ART competition was piloted with
					the support of the Nelson Mandela University's School of Music, Art
					and Design (SoMAD), and the Department of Basic Education in the
					Eastern Cape region.</p>

			<div class="col-md-12">
				<p>Entrants were required to come up with their own concept of
					Math-Art, within a suggested scope. The entry had to include a
					300-word description of how their artwork linked mathematics and
					art. There were two age categories: Grades 8 & 9 and Grades 10 to
					12. Judging was mostly based on the creativity in linking
					mathematics and arts.</p>
				<p>The pilot competition was overwhelmingly successful. It
					attracted 113 entries, mostly from learners in 36
					previously-disadvantaged schools in the Eastern Cape. Most of the
					entries were exhibited at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Art
					Museum in Port Elizabeth in May 2018.</p>
				<p>The Math-Art project has attracted the attention of the
					international Bridges organisation, an institution with whom GMMDC
					has had a collaboration since 2017 via an Erasmus Mundus research
					project funded by the European Union.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<p>Thirty MATH-ART entries from South Africa were part of an
					invited exhibit at the annual International Bridges Conference
					which took place at the National Museum of Science and Technology
					in Stockholm, Sweden, in July 2018.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<p>As a result of this interest, the project was expanded - with
					the support of Umalusi and the Department of Basic Education - to a
					national competition in 2019.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<p>593 entries were received from 75 schools in the 8 provinces
					in South Africa. All the entries were exhibited once again at the
					Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Art Museum in Port Elizabeth in June
					2019. Once again, the best entries were invited to exhibit at the
					International Bridges Conference in July, this time in Linz,
					Austria.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<p>The collaboration between the GMMDC and the Bridges
					organisation will continue as the competition expands every year
					and more stakeholders have expressed a keen interest to join this
					project as it seeks to promote STEAM education with the emphasis on
					integrating innovation and creativity as vital skills to meet the
					challenges of the 4IR.</p>
